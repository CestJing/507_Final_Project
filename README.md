The code is about looking for a museum in a specific state, and then looking for the restaurants near that chosen museum. 
First please input a state name. A wrong input will cause an error, a correct input will produce a list of museums (up to 50 records) in that state. 
Then, you can input a number of a specific museum, which will produce a list of restaurants (up to 50 records) around that museum, as well as a histogram showing the rating of these restaurants. 
When you input “back”, you can choose a new state. When you input “exit,” the program ends.
