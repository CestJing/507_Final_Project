507_Final_Project
（Python Packages: Requests, Plotly, BeautifulSoup, Sqlite3）

The code is about looking for a museum in a specific state, and then looking for the restaurants near that chosen museum. 
First please input a state name. A wrong input will cause an error, a correct input will produce a list of museums (up to 50 records) in that state. 
Then, you can input an index number of a specific museum, which will produce a list of restaurants (up to 50 records) around that museum, as well as a histogram showing the rating of these restaurants. You can repeat this step as many times as you want.
When you input “back”, you can choose a new state. When you input “exit,” the program ends.

In order to get information about restaurants from Yelp, we need API keys, which you can get from https://www.yelp.com/fusion. Click “Get Started”, create an account, then you can get your API key to run my code.
